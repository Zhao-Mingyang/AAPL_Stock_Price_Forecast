    "1. The locally stored datasets: Some dataset are downloaded from kaggle reuires the API token stored locally in ~/.kaggle file. The process cannot be slove with pip install kaggle. The download method will be provided but not run to download. Addtionally, AQI is more than 600 MB after download and natural disasters is 5 MB. Therefore, the datasets are preprocessed to filter the information then stored to online dataset. Please refer to aqi_natural_disaster_download(), disasters_cleaning() and disasters_cleaning() for the acquisition and cleaning steps.\n",
    "2. The twitter data scraping which required to run the commond lines under the root dictionary.\n",
    "3. The sentiment analysis of the news, Twitters and financial reports since it uses the pretrained FinBERT which needs the parameters downloaded. Please refer to Financial_Statements_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb for Sentiment Analysis.\n"

    "data that you will need, are the stock prices for each company from April 2017 to April 202 1 as\n",
    "described in Section 1. Since these companies are public, the data is made available online. The\n",
    "first task is for you to search and collect this data, finding the best way to access and download\n",
    "it. A good place to look is on platforms that provide free data relating to the stock market such as\n",

    "There are many valuable sources of information for analysing the stock market. In addition to time\n",

    "\n",
    "- Social Media, e.g., Twitter: This can be used to uncover the public’s sentimental\n",
    "response to the stock market\n",
    "- Financial reports: This can help explain what kind of factors are likely to affect the stock\n",
    "market the most\n",
    "- News: This can be used to draw links between current affairs and the stock market\n",
    "- Climate data: Sometimes weather data is directly correlated to some companies’ stock\n",

more than of net sales in and inc form competitionthe markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices the companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry wide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features including security features relative price and performance product quality and reliability design innovation strong third party software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large well funded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the companys products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peer to peer music and video companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware ios devices mac apple watch and apple tv software ios macos watchos and tvos online services and distribution of digital content and applications internet services some of the companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at loss to compete with the companys of componentsalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and the company often utilizes custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the companys supply of components were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating some mac computers are manufactured in the and ireland substantially all of the companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the companys products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the companys manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to inc form research and developmentbecause the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure continual and timely

able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the

exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following product introduction and often channel inventory of particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the companys future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial company offers limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end user the company also offers day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the companys hardware products in certain jurisdictions local law

and adversely affect the companys business financial condition operating results and stock of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the companys financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have material adverse effect on demand for the companys products and services demand also could differ materially from the companys expectations as result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the to correspond with the effect of strengthening of the dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the companys products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have number of effects on the companys business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the companys products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the companys ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these companys products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as result the company must make significant investments in the company currently holds significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the companys intellectual property the companys ability to maintain competitive advantage could be adversely inc form the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the companys product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the companys competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the companys existing products the companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its online and retail stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers many resellers have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys products apple inc form the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation company records write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to days because the companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within particular industry further limiting the companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the companys suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the companys ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements the supply of components for new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the companys direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the companys hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have negative impact on the companys cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively inc form the companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the companys company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation the companys online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the companys reputation the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available third party digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at reasonable cost and in timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the companys content companys future performance depends in part on support from third party software company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirty software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the companys products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products customers may choose not to buy the companys products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of thirty software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the macs prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the companys mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the companys ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the companys ios devices may suffer apple inc form the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at of the companys products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the example technology companies including many of the companys competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained the intellectual property rights claims against the company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the company has faced significant number of patent claims against it the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in number of jurisdictions and before the international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to third party or it may be subject to temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the companys operating expenses regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the companys operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle managements opinion there is not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss in excess of recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the companys company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in number of areas these and foreign laws and regulations affect the companys activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to carriers network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products apple inc form compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the companys customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies and procedures the companys business is subject to the risks of international company derives significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations violation by the companys employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the companys brand international growth efforts and company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid companys retail stores have required and will continue to require substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the companys retail stores decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the companys control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at reasonable in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present risks not originally company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the companys due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could among other things prevent access to the companys online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial inc form there may be breaches of the companys information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational companys business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the companys information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if computer security breach affects the companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the companys reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the companys products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to significant self insured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber

the issuer and any changes thereto and the companys intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the companys

accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and

carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have material impact on the companys financial condition and operating and other contingenciesas discussed in part item of this form under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records liability when it is probable that loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss in excess of recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely inc form item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate and foreign currency risk managementthe company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating rate riskthe companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the companys companys investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the companys liquidity requirements the company uses combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the companys investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the companys debt as of september and september to increase by million and million on an annualized basis details regarding the companys debt is provided in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note currency riskin general the company is net receiver of currencies other than the dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular strengthening of the dollar will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in dollars there is risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and may enter in the future into non designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign denominated debt issuances the companys practice is to hedge portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular inc form to provide meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying future gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the

all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on recurring basis the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or inc form the companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for

components for new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected

services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices many of the companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures the companys financial

they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive price competition frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peer to peer music and video companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the companys ability to

some of the companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at loss to compete with the companys of componentsalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources few components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the companys supply of components for new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating inc form substantially all of the companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the and ireland significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the companys products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the companys manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to and developmentbecause the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through

intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the and number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its company regularly files patent applications

patents including utility patents design patents and company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the companys products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its of the companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the companys products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it

set forth in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following product introduction and often channel inventory of particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the companys future pattern of

companys products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as result the company must make significant investments in the company currently holds significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulatingthe companysproducts and infringing onitsintellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the companys intellectual property the companys ability to maintain competitive advantage could be adversely inc form the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services including third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has minority market share in the global smartphone market additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the companys product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications some of the companys competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos which has minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the companys existing products the companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys inc form the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation company records write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to days because the companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within particular industry further limiting the companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions onthe companys suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the companys ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements the supply of components for new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the companys direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the companys hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have negative impact on the companys cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively inc form the companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the companys company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation the companys online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the companys company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at reasonable cost and in timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the companys content companys future performance depends in part on support from third party software company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the companys products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products customers may choose not to buy the companys respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the companys products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the macs prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the companys mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the companys ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the companys ios devices may inc form the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at of the companys products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of claim against an indemnified third against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in number of jurisdictions and before the international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the companys operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the companys operating managements opinion there is not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss in excess of recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the companys company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in number of and foreign laws

cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to carriers network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain inc form compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the companys customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies and companys business is subject to the risks of international company derives significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations violation by the companys employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the companys brand international growth efforts and company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid companys retail stores have required and will continue to require substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the companys retail stores decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the companys control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at reasonable in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present risks not originally company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks

relates to non dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the dollar adversely affects the dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the companys products margins on sales of the companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the dollar value of the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the dollar while generally beneficial to the companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than portion of the adverse financial

third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september significant portion of the companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well

sale securities impact the companys net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this determination the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the companys intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the companys assessment of whether security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in

the company records write down for inventories of components and products including third party products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturing related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair industries in which the company competes are subject to rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write downs of inventory and or impairments of manufacturing related assets or inventory prepayments these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the companys products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the companys suppliers that hold any of the companys manufacturing related assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such write downs would adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional write downs were company accrues for estimated purchase

manufacturing requirements for periods up to days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products change in the companys product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and inc form warranty coststhe company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the companys typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities could be required and could materially affect the companys financial condition and operating taxesthe company records tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the companys deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have material impact on the companys financial condition and operating and other contingenciesas discussed in part item of this form under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records liability when it is probable that loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss in excess of recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely inc form item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate and foreign currency risk managementthe company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating rate riskthe companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the companys companys investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the companys liquidity requirements the company uses combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy generally requires investments to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the companys investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the companys debt as of september and september to increase by million and million on an annualized basis details regarding the companys debt is provided in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note currency riskin general the company is net receiver of currencies other than the dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular strengthening of the dollar will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in dollars there is risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign denominated debt issuances the company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular inc form to provide meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying future gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of

accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on recurring basis the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or inc form the companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in

custom applications as well as remote device single customer accounted for more than of net sales in and markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices many of the companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures the companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry wide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation strong third party software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large well funded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the companys products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive price competition frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and inc form the companys services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware ios devices mac apple watch and apple tv software ios macos watchos and tvos online services and distribution of digital content and applications digital content and services some of the companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at loss to compete with the companys of componentsalthough most components essential to the companys business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the companys supply of components for new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating all of the companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the and ireland significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are single sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the companys products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the companys manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to and developmentbecause the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third party businesses and propertythe company currently holds broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the and number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its inc form the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the time the company has accumulated large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the companys products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its of the companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the companys products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the companys products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third and domestic operations and geographic dataduring the companys domestic and international net sales accounted for and respectively of total net margins on the companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following product introduction and channel inventory of particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the companys future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial company offers limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end user the company also offers day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the companys hardware products in certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for period prescribed by statute typically at least two years in addition where available consumers may purchase app or ac which extends service coverage on many of the companys hardware the companys experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered reliable indicator of the companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial of september the company had approximately full time equivalent inc form available informationthe companys annual reports on form quarterly reports on form current reports on form

condition operating results and stock of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the companys financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations financial condition and company has international operations with sales outside the representing majority of the companys total net sales in addition majority of the companys supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the as result the companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the companys products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the companys products uncertainty about or decline in global or regional economic conditions could have significant impact on the companys suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the companys products and downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the companys trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the companys ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the companys financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations financial condition and markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these companys products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as result the company must make significant investments in there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services company currently holds significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulatingthe companysproducts and infringing onitsintellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the companys intellectual property the companys ability to maintain competitive advantage could be adversely inc form the company has minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the companys competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at the company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the companys product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated of the markets in which the company competes including the market for personal computers have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted in addition an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the companys existing companys services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys inc form the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation company records write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur write downs fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to days because the companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within particular industry further limiting the companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions onthe companys suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations financial condition and growth above also could affect the companys ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements if the companys supply of components for new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the companys direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could company relies on single sourced outsourcing partners in the asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the companys hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have negative impact on the companys cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade inc form the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively companys products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the companys business and result in harm to the companys company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects may also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the companys products unsafe and create risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the companys products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the companys service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as result the companys services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the companys products and services in addition the company may be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications write offs of inventory property plant and equipment and or intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the companys products and services and result in harm to the companys reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and services introductions and lost company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at reasonable cost and in timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the companys content companys future performance depends in part on support from third party software company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the companys products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products customers may choose not to buy the companys company believes the availability of third party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the companys products compared to competitors platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and inc form the companys minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the companys devices may company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the companys products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied company sells and delivers third party applications for its products through the app store mac app store and tv app store the company retains commission from sales through these platforms if developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in app purchases to customers then the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at of the companys products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of claim against an indemnified third against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in number of jurisdictions and before the international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the companys operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the companys operating as described in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss in excess of recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may inc form the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the companys company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in number of and foreign laws and regulations affect the companys activities in areas including but not limited to labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements anti competition environmental health and way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to carriers network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the companys products and services less attractive to the companys customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies and companys business is subject to the risks of international company derives majority of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations violation by the companys employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the companys brand international growth efforts and company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and international trade disputes gross margins on the companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid companys retail stores have required and will continue to require substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the companys retail stores decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance companys retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the companys financial condition and operating results including macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include but are not limited to the companys ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at reasonable inc form investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the companys ongoing business and present risks not originally company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the companys due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the companys business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the companys business by among other things preventing access to the companys online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the companys products these events could materially adversely affect the companys reputation financial condition and operating may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational companys business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information pii with respect to the companys customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the companys reputation financial condition and operating companys business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the companys reputation financial condition and operating example the company may experience security breach impacting the companys information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the companys ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the companys stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the companys information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the companys products and addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the companys compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in manner not permitted by law or under the companys agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or inc form under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the companys reputation financial condition and operating the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain

apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key of the companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the companys key personnel are companys business may be impacted by political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the companys business tariffs could increase the cost of the companys products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs could also make the companys products more expensive for customers which could make the companys products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the companys ability to offer its products and services political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the companys of the companys operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the companys suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the companys control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the companys service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations and lose significant revenue because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the inc form the companys operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the companys suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the companys business and harm to the companys reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the companys suppliers and contract company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to companys profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the companys financial results may be materially adversely impacted as result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the company sells shifts in the geographic currency or channel mix of the companys sales component cost increases price competition or the introduction of new products including new products with higher cost company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates majority of its net sales from single product and decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lower than anticipated demand for the companys products issues with new product introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the companys logistics components supply or manufacturing companys stock price is subject to companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the companys board of directors and the companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the dollar relative to local companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to dollardenominated sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate of foreign currencies relative to the dollar adversely affects the dollar value of the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the companys products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the dollars strengthening which would adversely affect the dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currencydenominated strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the dollar while generally beneficial to the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in inc form the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors as result the value and liquidity of the companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses and could have material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers substantial majority of the companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance the companys exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september significant portion of the companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were

customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the companys operating inc form valuation and impairment of marketable securitiesthe companys investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair

sheets changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact the companys net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this determination the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the companys intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the companys assessment of whether security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security which would have an adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating valuation valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation feesthe company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product shipments and invests in manufacturing related assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities in addition the company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory the company performs regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends if the company determines inventories of components and products including third party products held for resale have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value it records write down of the inventories the company also reviews its manufacturing related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value any write downs and or impairments the company may be required to record would adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled manufacturing purchase obligations cover the companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the companys products change in the companys product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products the company may be required to record accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its operating coststhe company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside of the companys typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the companys financial condition and operating taxesthe company records tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company records valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate inc form management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to recover the companys deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have material impact on the companys financial condition and operating december the enacted the act which significantly changed tax law the act lowered the companys statutory federal income tax rate from to effective january while also imposing deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income the act also created new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings the impact of the act increased the companys provision for income taxes by billion during this increase was composed of billionrelated to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and billion associated with the deemed repatriation tax partially offset by billion impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the companys unrecognized tax benefits certain amounts reported by the company related to the act are provisional estimates in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no resolution of the acts effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have material impact on the companys financial condition and operating and other contingenciesas discussed in part item of this form under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records liability when it is probable that loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss in excess of recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate and foreign currency risk managementthe company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating rate riskthe companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the companys companys investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the companys liquidity requirements the company uses combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the companys investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the companys investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to inc form as of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the companys debt as of september and september to increase by million and million on an annualized basis details regarding the companys debt is provided in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note currency riskin general the company is net receiver of currencies other than the dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular strengthening of the dollar will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in dollars there is risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currencydenominated debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular provide meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying future gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the

tablets and other electronic devices therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant commodity pricing company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all of the companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the and and developmentbecause the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third party businesses and propertythe company currently holds broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the and various foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the companys products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its addition to company owned intellectual property many of the companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the companys products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses the timing of product introductions can also impact the companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following product launch and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of newer product approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate product of september

including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the companys actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the companys business financial condition operating results and stock of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the companys financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations financial condition and company has international operations with sales outside the representing majority of the companys total net sales in addition majority of the companys supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the as result the companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the companys products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the companys products uncertainty about or decline in global or regional economic conditions could have significant impact on the companys suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the companys products and downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the companys trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the companys ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the companys financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations financial condition and markets for the companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these companys products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as result the company must make significant investments in there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services company currently holds significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and copyrights in contrast many of the companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the companys products and infringing on itsintellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the companys intellectual property the companys ability to maintain competitive advantage could be adversely inc form the company has minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the companys competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the companys product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated of the markets in which the company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted in addition an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the companys existing companys services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the companys ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and resells third party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs can require substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the companys inc form the company is exposed to the risk of write downs on the value of its inventory and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation company records write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur write downs fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to days because the companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase operating results depend upon the companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating results while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within particular industry further limiting the companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the companys suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the companys business results of operations financial condition and growth above also could affect the companys ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements if the companys supply of components for new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the all of the companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the companys direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out of warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could company relies on single source outsourcing partners in the asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the companys hardware products any failure of these partners to perform can have negative impact on the companys cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade inc form the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively companys products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the companys business and result in harm to the companys company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the companys products unsafe and create risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the companys products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the companys service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as result the companys services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the companys products and services in addition the company can be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications write offs of inventory property plant and equipment and or intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the companys products and services and result in harm to the companys reputation

content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available content the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the companys access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at reasonable cost and in timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the companys content companys future performance depends in part on support from third party software company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the companys products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the companys products customers may choose not to buy the companys company believes the availability of third party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the companys products compared to competitors platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and inc form the companys minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the companys devices may company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the companys products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied company sells and delivers third party applications for its products through the app store mac app store tv app store and watch app store the company retains commission from sales through these platforms if developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in app purchases to customers then the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at of the companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties which requires licenses from those third parties in addition because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents the companys products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties based on experience and industry practice the company believes licenses to such third party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of claim against an indemnified third against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several jurisdictions as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial of the merit of particular claims litigation can be expensive time consuming disruptive to the companys operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the companys cost of sales and operating as described in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss greater than recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in reporting period for amounts above managements expectations the companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating

laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies and procedures if the company is found to have violated laws and regulations it could materially adversely affect the companys reputation financial condition and operating technology industry including in some instances the company is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which exposes the company to government investigations legal actions and penalties for example the company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the company that could individually or in the aggregate have material impact on the companys financial condition and operating results there can be no assurance that the companys business will not be materially adversely affected individually or in the aggregate by the outcomes of such investigations or changes to laws and regulations in the companys retail stores have required and will continue to require substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the companys more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the companys retail stores decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance companys retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the companys financial condition and operating results including macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include but are not limited to the companys ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage

failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the companys business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the companys business by among other things preventing access to the companys online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the companys products these events could materially adversely affect the companys reputation financial condition and operating inc form there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally

suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the companys reputation financial condition and operating example the company may experience security breach impacting the companys information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the companys ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the companys stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages

encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the companys information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the companys products and addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company is also subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data is subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the companys compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in manner not permitted by law or under the companys agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment

the companys products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs can also make the companys products more expensive for customers which could make the companys products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other measures that could limit the companys ability to offer its products and services political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and measures could also have negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the companys of the companys operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the companys suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the companys control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the companys supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the companys service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the companys operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the companys suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the companys business and harm to the companys reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent

losses that may company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to companys profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example gross margins on the companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time the companys gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to variety of factors

statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be believes the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the companys board of recognitionthe company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone mac ipad and certain other products the first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product related bundled services which include icloud siri and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive on when and if available basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand alone selling prices ssps because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the companys estimated ssps revenue allocated to the product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on straight line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided the companys process for determining estimated ssps involves managements judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the companys ssps and the future rate of related amortization for product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the nature of the product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights

company invests in manufacturing related assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long term agreements to secure the supply of inventory the company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled the companys estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are the key inputs in the determination of the recoverability of manufacturing related assets and the assessment of the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the companys products change in the companys product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the companys products the company may be required to record write downs or impairments of manufacturing related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation coststhe company offers limited warranties on its new hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products and customers may purchase extended service coverage where available on many of the companys hardware products the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the companys typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be taxesthe company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these

legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records liability when it is probable that loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss greater than recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in reporting period for amounts above managements expectations the companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate and foreign currency risk managementthe company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating rate riskthe companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the companys inc form the companys investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the companys liquidity requirements the company uses combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the companys investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the companys investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the companys debt as of september and september to increase by million and million on an annualized basis currency riskin general the company is net receiver of currencies other than the dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular strengthening of the dollar will negatively affect the companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in dollars there is risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currencydenominated debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying future gains and losses associated with the companys investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount

online stores and its direct sales force the company also employs variety of indirect distribution channels such as third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers during the company net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for and respectively of total net sales no single customer accounted for more than of net sales in and competition the markets for the company products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses many of the company competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by emulating the company products and infringing on its intellectual property the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services principal competitive factors important to the company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation strong third party software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation apple inc form the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices and services the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and service offerings with large customer bases in addition some of the company competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at loss the company services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate the company product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer supply of components although most components essential to the company business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company requirements the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all substantially all of the company hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the and ireland research and development because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third party businesses and technology intellectual property the company currently holds broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the and various foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products in addition to company owned intellectual property many of the company products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all apple inc form business seasonality and product introductions the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses the timing of product introductions can also impact the company net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following product launch and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of newer product approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate product introduction employees as of september the company had approximately full time equivalent employees available information the company annual reports on form quarterly reports on form current reports on form and amendments to reports filed pursuant to sections and of the securities exchange act of as amended the act are filed with the securities and exchange commission the such reports and other information filed by the company with the sec are available free of

currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company business financial condition operating results and stock price because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods the company business results of operations financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid pandemic covid has spread rapidly throughout the world prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations temporary closures of businesses and quarantines and shelter in place orders the covid pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets the covid pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the company business results of operations financial condition and stock price following the initial outbreak of the virus the company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners resulting in temporary iphone supply shortages that affected sales worldwide during the course of the pandemic the company retail stores as well as channel partner points of sale have been temporarily closed at various times in many cases where stores and points of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers the company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely the company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities the full extent of the impact of the covid pandemic on the company operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the company control including without limitation the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products additional future impacts on the company may include but are not limited to material adverse effects on demand for the company products and services the company supply chain and sales and distribution channels the company ability to execute its strategic plans and the company profitability and cost structure to the extent the covid pandemic adversely affects the company business results of operations financial condition and stock price it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this part item of this form global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company business results of operations financial condition and growth the company has international operations with sales outside the representing majority of the company total net sales in addition majority of the company supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the as result the company operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the company products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors apple inc form in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company products uncertainty about or decline in global or regional economic conditions could have significant impact on the company suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company products and insolvency downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the company business results of operations financial condition and growth global markets for the company products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as result the company must make significant investments in there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully the company currently holds significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and copyrights in contrast many of the company competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by emulating the company products and infringing on its intellectual property effective intellectual property protection may not be consistently available in every country in which the company operates if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company intellectual property the company ability to maintain competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company has minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at loss some of the markets in which the company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they

integrated solutions the company services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively apple inc form to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and resells third party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs can require substantial investment

and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur write downs fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to days because the company markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments apple inc form future operating results depend upon the company ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company financial condition and operating results while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within particular industry further limiting the company ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company suppliers described in and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company business results of operations financial condition and growth above also could affect the company ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company requirements if the company supply of components for new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the substantially all of the company manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the company direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out of warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on single source outsourcing partners in the asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company hardware products any failure of these partners to perform can have negative impact on the company cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted apple inc form the company products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company business and result in harm to the company reputation the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company products unsafe and create risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the company service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as result the company services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company products and services in addition the company can be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications write offs of inventory property plant and equipment and or intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the company products and services and result in harm to the company reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available content the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms if at all some third content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have material adverse impact on the company financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at reasonable cost and in timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company content providers the company future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company products customers may choose not to buy the company products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company products compared to competitors platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services the company minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company devices may suffer apple inc form the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers the company sells and delivers third party applications for its products through the app store for the vast majority of applications developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the app store the company only retains commission from sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where developer offers purchases for digital features services or goods within an application if developers reduce their use of the company platforms including in app purchases then the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease if the rate of the commission that the company retains on such sales is reduced or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated the company financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties which requires licenses from those third parties in addition because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents the company products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties based on experience and industry practice the company believes licenses to such third party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have material adverse impact on the company financial condition and operating results the company financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations the company is subject to various claims legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new matters may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of claim against an indemnified third party the number of claims legal proceedings and government investigations involving the company and the alleged magnitude of such claims proceedings and government investigations has generally increased over time and may continue to increase the company has faced and continues to face significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several jurisdictions as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company cost of sales and operating expenses except as described in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note and contingencies under the heading in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss greater than recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights the outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in reporting period for amounts above management expectations the company financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company and could require the company to change its business practices or limit the company ability to offer certain products and services all of which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise apple inc form the company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide which

jurisdictions around the world which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the company that could individually or in the aggregate have materially adverse impact on the company financial condition and operating results in addition if enacted legislative and other proposals to further regulate technology companies could result in changes to the company business including requiring the

required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company retail stores decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores including as result of protective public safety measures in response to the covid pandemic could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of

in tariffs sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the company business for example tensions between the and china have led to series of tariffs being imposed by the on imports from china mainland as well as other business restrictions tariffs may increase the cost of the company products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs can also make the company products more expensive for customers which could make the company products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other measures such as controls on imports or exports of goods technology or data that could adversely impact the company

earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues including pandemics such as the covid pandemic and other events beyond the company control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales because the company relies on single or limited

across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example the gross margins on the company products and services vary significantly and can change over time the company gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures increased competition the company ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services compressed product life cycles potential increases in the cost of components outside manufacturing services and developing acquiring and delivering content for the company services the company ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively shifts in the mix of products and services or in the geographic currency or channel mix fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the introduction of new products or services including new products or services with higher cost structures these and other factors could have materially adverse impact on the company financial condition and operating results the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses further the company generates significant portion of its net sales from single product and decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lower than anticipated demand for the company products or services issues with new product or service introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company stock price is subject to volatility the company stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock price at given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company board of directors and the company share repurchase program does not obligate

value of the dollar relative to local currencies the company primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non dollar sales cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the dollar adversely affects the dollar value of the company foreign currency sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the dollar strengthening which would adversely affect the dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency sales apple inc form conversely strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the dollar while generally beneficial to the company foreign currency sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio the company investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors as result the value and liquidity of the company cash cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have material adverse impact on the company financial condition and operating results the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers substantial majority of the company outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance and significant portion of the company trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers the company exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september the company vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates

installments in accordance with the act other non current liabilities the company remaining other non current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and the company discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material management believes the company critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company board of directors revenue recognition the company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone mac ipad and certain other products the first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product related bundled services which include icloud siri and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive on when and if available basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand alone selling prices because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the company estimated ssps revenue allocated to the product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on straight line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided the company process for determining estimated ssps involves management judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company ssps and the future rate of related amortization for product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the nature of the product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees the company invests in manufacturing related assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long term agreements to secure the supply of inventory the company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled the company estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing related assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the company products change in the company product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company products the company may be required to record write downs or impairments of manufacturing related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees apple inc form warranty costs the company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products and customers may purchase extended service coverage where available on many of the company hardware products the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the company typical experience if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required income taxes the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in manner inconsistent with management expectations could have material impact on the company financial condition and operating results legal and other contingencies as discussed in part item of this form under the heading proceedings and in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records liability when it is probable that loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note and contingencies under the heading in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss greater than recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in reporting period for amounts above management expectations the company financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company financial condition and operating results interest rate risk the company exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the company cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company debt the company investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company liquidity requirements the company uses combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity apple inc form as of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company debt as of september and september to increase by million and million on an annualized basis respectively foreign currency risk in general the company is net receiver of currencies other than the dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular strengthening of the dollar will negatively affect the company net sales and gross margins as expressed in dollars there is risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures to provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company foreign currency derivative positions the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the company foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company actual exposures and positions apple inc form item financial statements and supplementary data index to consolidated financial

during the company net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for and respectively of total net sales competition the markets for the company products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses many of the company competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by imitating the company products and infringing on its intellectual property the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services principal competitive factors important to the company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation strong third party software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation apple inc form the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories and services the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and service offerings with large customer bases in addition some of the company competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at loss the company services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer supply of components although most components essential to the company business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company requirements the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all substantially all of the company hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the and ireland research and development because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure continual and timely flow of competitive products

development licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third party businesses and technology intellectual property the company currently holds broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the and various foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products in addition to company owned intellectual property many of the company products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all apple inc form business seasonality and product introductions the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses the timing of product introductions can also impact the company net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following product launch and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of newer product approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors

businesses to take unprecedented measures in response such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations temporary closures of businesses and quarantine and shelter in place orders the covid pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets the covid pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the company business results of operations and financial condition as well as the price of the company stock during the course of the pandemic certain of the company component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide and similar disruptions could occur in the future the company retail stores as well as channel partner points of sale have been temporarily closed at various times in many cases as stores and points of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers the company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely the company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities the extent to which the covid pandemic may impact the company operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the company control including the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the emergence of new variants the development availability distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments the imposition of protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products additional future impacts on the company may include but are not limited to material adverse effects on demand for the company products and services the company supply chain and sales and distribution channels the company ability to execute its strategic plans and the company profitability and cost structure to the extent the covid pandemic adversely affects the company business results of operations financial condition and stock price it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this part item of this form macroeconomic and industry risks the company operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company business results of operations and financial condition the company has international operations with sales outside the representing majority of the company total net sales in addition the company global supply chain is large and complex and majority of the company supplier facilities including manufacturing and assembly sites are located outside the as result the company operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the company products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors apple inc form in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company products uncertainty about or decline in global or regional economic conditions can have significant impact on the company suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company products and insolvency downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company financial instruments these and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the company business results of operations and financial condition the company business can be impacted by political events trade and other international disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions political events trade

economy and could have material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners the company has large global business and the company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the company business for example tensions between the and china have led to series of tariffs being imposed by the on imports from china mainland as well as other business restrictions tariffs increase the cost of the company products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs can also make the company products more expensive for customers which could make the company products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other measures such as controls on imports or exports of goods technology or data that could adversely impact the company operations and supply chain and limit the company ability to offer its products and services as designed these measures can require the company to take various actions including changing suppliers restructuring business relationships and ceasing to offer third party applications on its platforms changing the company operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company operations and distracting to management such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company business many of the company operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks labor disputes public health issues including pandemics such as the covid pandemic and other events beyond the company control global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events can make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company service offerings following an interruption to its business the company can require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company the company operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company business and harm to the company reputation major public health issues including pandemics such as the covid pandemic have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect the company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products the imposition of protective public safety measures such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions and disruptions in the company supply chain and sales and distribution channels resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise apple inc form global markets for the company products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life

successfully the company currently holds significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register additional patents trademarks and copyrights in contrast many of the company competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by imitating the company products and infringing on its intellectual property effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the company operates if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company intellectual property the company ability to maintain competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company has minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at loss some of the markets in which the company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the company approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company business results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the company ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively business risks to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on number of factors including timely and successful development market acceptance the company ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp up issues the availability of application software for the company products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies there can be no assurance the company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services apple inc form the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the substantially all of the company manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the company direct control over production and distribution such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided or adversely affect the company flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement the company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out of warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an unanticipated product defect liability from time to time while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the company business reputation results of operations and financial condition the company relies on single source outsourcing partners in the asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company hardware products any failure of these partners to perform can have negative impact on the company cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for variety of reasons including natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted future operating results depend upon the company ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the company business results of operations and financial condition for example the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply which has adversely affected and could materially adversely affect the company ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within particular industry further limiting the company ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company suppliers described in company operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company business results of operations and financial condition above can also affect the company ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition the company new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company requirements when the company supply of components for new or existing product has been delayed or constrained or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company business results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the company business results of operations and financial condition the company business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source apple inc form the company products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company business and result in harm to the company reputation the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects can also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company products unsafe and create risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the company service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as result the company services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company products and services in addition the company can be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications write offs of inventory property plant and equipment and or intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the company products and services and result in harm to the company reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales the company is exposed to the risk of write downs on the value of its inventory and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable there can be no assurance the company will not incur write downs fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to days because the company markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties which requires licenses from those third parties in addition because of technological changes in the industries in which the company currently competes or in the future may compete current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents the company products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties based on experience and industry practice the company believes licenses to such third party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms can preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have material adverse impact on the company business results of operations and financial condition the company future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there can be no assurance third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company products customers may choose not to buy the company products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company products compared to competitors platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets windows for personal computers and tablets and playstation nintendo and xbox for gaming platforms this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services apple inc form the company minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share when developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company devices can suffer the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and when third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers the company distributes third party applications for its products through the app store for the vast majority of applications developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the app store the company only retains commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application from time to time the company has made changes to its app store including actions taken in response to competition market and legal conditions the company may make further business changes in the future new legislative initiatives such as the proposed european union digital markets act could if enacted require further changes the company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the app store which have resulted in changes to the company business practices and may in the future result in further changes these changes could include how and to what extent the company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the app store this could reduce the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease if the rate of the commission that the company retains on such sales is reduced or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated the company business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the company customers or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have material adverse impact on the company business results of operations and financial condition the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell or offer subscriptions to third party content as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the company own services the licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules the company also produces its own digital content which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent content and subscribers and may fail to appeal to the company customers the covid pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there can be no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at reasonable cost and in timely manner the company success depends largely on the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees including key personnel much of the company future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company key personnel are located the company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is significant driver of its success if the company is unable to nurture and maintain its culture it could adversely affect the company ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees and materially adversely affect the company business results of operations and financial condition the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and resells third party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force some carriers providing cellular network service for the company products offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device there can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts apple inc form the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs can require substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company products the company business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions the company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company or its vendors business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company business by among other things preventing access to the company online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company products these events could materially adversely affect the company business reputation results of operations and financial condition losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personal information could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company business requires it to use and store confidential information including personal information with respect to the company customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company business reputation results of operations and financial condition the company business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties the company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the company behalf such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the company business reputation results of operations and financial condition the company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on regular basis these attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations and could among other things impair the company ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the price of the company stock materially damage commercial relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company globally attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls avoid detection and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence all of which hinders the company ability to identify investigate and recover from incidents although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including personal information affect many companies across various industries the company is at relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking ransomware attacks employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties can fraudulently induce the company or its vendors employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which can in turn be used for unauthorized access to the company or its vendors systems and services to help protect customers and the company the company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company products and services while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise apple inc form investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company ongoing business present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the company business reputation results of operations and financial condition the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses economic political legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses regions or countries inadequate return on capital potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and significant write investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on timely basis or at all or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the company from completing transaction or otherwise limit the company ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of transaction these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the company business reputation results of operations and financial condition the company retail stores have required and will continue to require substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company retail stores decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores including as result of protective public safety measures in response to the covid pandemic could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs the company retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company business results of operations and financial condition including macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include the company ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at reasonable cost legal and regulatory compliance risks the company business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations the company is subject to various claims legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new matters may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the company to costs and damages in the event of claim against an indemnified third party the number of claims legal proceedings and government investigations involving the company and the alleged magnitude of such claims proceedings and government investigations has generally increased over time and may continue to increase the company has faced and continues to face significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several jurisdictions as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges there can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements can also significantly increase the company cost of sales and operating expenses and require the company to change its business practices and limit the company ability to offer certain products and services except as described in part item of this form under the heading proceedings and in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note and contingencies under the heading in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss greater than recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims apple inc form the outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in reporting period for amounts above management expectations the company results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome can result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company and can require the company to change its business practices and limit the company ability to offer certain products and services all of which could materially adversely affect the company business results of operations and

actions taken in response to competition market and legal conditions the company may make further business changes in the future new legislative initiatives such as the proposed eu digital markets act could if enacted require further changes these changes could include how and to what extent the company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the app store the company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the company that could individually or in the aggregate have materially adverse impact on the company business results of operations and financial condition for example the company is the subject of investigations in europe and other jurisdictions relating to app store terms and conditions if such investigations result in adverse findings against the company the company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its app store business all of which could materially adversely affect the company business results of operations and financial condition the company is also subject to litigation relating to the app store which has resulted in changes to the company business practices and may in the future result in further changes further the company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that if resolved against those other companies could adversely affect the company commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the company business results of operations and financial condition for example the company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the company platforms and apps and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings there can be no assurance the company business will not be materially adversely affected individually or in the aggregate by the outcomes of such investigations litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future changes to the company business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the company products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the company products and services and result in harm to the company reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services and lost sales apple inc form the company business is subject to variety of and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of various types of personal information in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also restrict transfers of personal information among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy information provided on its website press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability in addition to the risks generally relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personal information the company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws such as health data financial data and biometric data health data is subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in manner not permitted by law or under the company agreements with healthcare institutions the company can be subject to litigation or government investigations and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines financial data such as payment card data is also subject to additional requirements under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company business reputation results of operations and financial condition financial risks the company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate the company profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example the gross margins on the company products and services vary significantly and can change over time the company gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures increased competition the company ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services compressed product life cycles potential increases in the cost of components outside manufacturing services and developing acquiring and delivering content for the company services the company ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively shifts in the mix of products and services or in the geographic currency or channel mix including to the extent that regulatory changes require the company to modify its product and service offerings fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the introduction of new products or services including new products or services with higher cost structures these and other factors could have materially adverse impact on the company results of operations and financial condition the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses further the company generates significant portion of its net sales from single product and decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lower than anticipated demand for the company products or services issues with new product or service introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the dollar relative to local currencies the company primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non dollar sales cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations apple inc form the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the dollar adversely affects the dollar value of the company foreign currency sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the dollar strengthening which would adversely affect the dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency sales conversely strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the dollar while generally beneficial to the company foreign currency sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio the company investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors as result the value and liquidity of the company cash cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable and non marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have material adverse impact on the company results of operations and financial condition the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers substantial majority of the company outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance and significant portion of the company trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers the company exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september the company vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company is subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where number of the company subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the introduction of new taxes or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the and ireland the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company effective tax rates were

statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and the company discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported note of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this form describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities uncertain tax positions the company is subject to income taxes in the and numerous foreign jurisdictions the evaluation of the company uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of gaap and complex domestic and international tax laws including the act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries although management believes the company reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the company reserves reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of tax examination or the refinement of an estimate resolution of these uncertainties in manner inconsistent with management expectations could have material impact on the company financial condition and operating results legal and other contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain the company records liability when it is probable that loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment resolution of legal matters in manner inconsistent with management expectations could have material impact on the company financial condition and operating results apple inc form item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company financial condition and operating results interest rate risk the company exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the company cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company debt the company investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company liquidity requirements the company uses combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity as of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company debt as of september and september to increase by million and million on an annualized basis respectively foreign currency risk in general the company is net receiver of currencies other than the dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular strengthening of the dollar will negatively affect the company net sales and gross margins as expressed in dollars there is risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures apple inc form to provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company foreign currency derivative positions the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the company foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company actual exposures and positions apple inc form item financial statements and supplementary data index to

inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data note revenue recognition net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iphone mac ipad services and other products the company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers control is generally transferred when the company has present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers for most of the company products net sales control transfers when products

control or commencement of delivery of services as applicable the company records reductions to products net sales related to future product returns price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the company expectations and historical experience for arrangements with multiple performance obligations which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct the company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand alone selling prices when available the company uses observable prices to determine ssps when observable prices are not available ssps are established that reflect the company best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on stand alone basis the company process for estimating ssps without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including where applicable prices charged by the company for similar offerings market trends in the pricing for similar offerings product specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation the company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone mac ipad and certain other products the first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product related bundled services which include icloud xae siri and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive on when and if available basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative ssps because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the company estimated ssps revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer which generally occurs when the product is shipped revenue allocated to the product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on straight line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software including estimated warranty costs are recognized at the time of sale costs incurred to provide product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred for certain long term service arrangements the company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered for these arrangements the company does not have right to bill for the undelivered services the company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services accordingly the company has not recognized revenue and has elected not to disclose amounts related to these undelivered services for the sale of third party products where the company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer the company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers the company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third party products including but not limited to evaluating if it can establish the price of the product retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product for third party applications sold through the app store and certain digital content sold through the company other digital content stores the company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to
