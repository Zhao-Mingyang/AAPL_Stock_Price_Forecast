constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be

obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to days because the companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results

to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar

limiting the companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the companys suppliers described

initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys requirements the

based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained the intellectual property rights claims against the company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the company has faced significant number of patent claims against it the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in number of jurisdictions and before the international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to third party or it may be subject to temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the companys operating expenses regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the companys operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle managements

and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss in excess of recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely inc form quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate and foreign currency risk managementthe company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the companys financial condition and operating rate riskthe companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the companys companys investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the companys liquidity requirements the company uses combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the companys investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on

associated with certain of the companys foreign currency derivative positions the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair

estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the

claim against an indemnified third against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in number of jurisdictions and before the international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the companys operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the companys operating managements opinion there is not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss in excess of recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting

production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the

some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the companys company has entered into

future on reasonable terms or at seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses the timing of product introductions can

cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled the companys estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are the key inputs in the determination of the recoverability of manufacturing related assets and the assessment of the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals if there is an abrupt and

the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the companys typical experience the company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or

that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such

2020,products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses many of the company competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by emulating the company products and infringing on its intellectual property the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services principal competitive factors important to the company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation strong third party software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation apple inc form the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices and services the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and service offerings with large customer bases in addition some of the company competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at loss the company services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate the company product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer supply of components although most components essential to the company business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company requirements the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all substantially all of the company hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the and ireland research and development because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third party businesses and technology intellectual property the company currently holds broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the and various foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products in addition to company owned intellectual property many of the company products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all apple inc form business seasonality and product introductions the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses the timing of product introductions can also impact the company net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following product launch and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of newer product approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate product introduction employees as of september the company had approximately full time

intellectual property protection may not be consistently available in every country in which the company operates if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company intellectual property the company ability to maintain competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company has minority market

maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively apple inc form to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and resells third party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs can require substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company products the company is exposed to the risk of write downs on the value of its inventory and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur write downs fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to days because the company markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments apple inc form future operating results depend upon the company ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many

limiting the company ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company suppliers described in and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company business results of operations financial condition and growth above also could affect the company ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company requirements if the company supply of components for new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the substantially all of the company manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the company direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services

the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material management believes the company critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company board of directors revenue recognition the company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone mac ipad and certain other products the first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product related bundled services which include icloud siri and maps the third performance obligation is the right to receive on when and if available basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand alone selling prices because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the company estimated ssps revenue allocated to the product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on straight line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided the company process for determining estimated ssps involves management judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable should future facts and circumstances change the company ssps and the future rate of related amortization for product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change factors subject to change include the nature of the product related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees the company invests in manufacturing related assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long term agreements to secure the supply of inventory the company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled the company estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing related assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the company products change in the company product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company products the company may be required to record write downs or impairments of manufacturing related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees apple inc form warranty costs the company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products and customers may purchase extended service coverage where available on many of the company hardware products the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the company typical experience if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required income taxes the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in manner inconsistent with management expectations could have material impact on the company financial condition and operating results legal and other contingencies as discussed in part item of this form under the heading proceedings and in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records liability when it is probable that loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item of this form in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note and contingencies under the heading in the opinion of management there was not at least reasonable possibility the company may have incurred material loss or material loss greater than recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in reporting period for amounts above management expectations the company financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company financial condition and operating results interest rate risk the company exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the company cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company debt the company investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company liquidity requirements the company uses combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity apple inc form as of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company debt as of september and september to

2020,respectively foreign currency risk in general the company is net receiver of currencies other than the dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular strengthening of the dollar will negatively affect the company net sales and gross margins as expressed in dollars there is risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures to provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company foreign currency derivative positions the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the company foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company actual exposures and positions

during the company net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for and respectively of total net sales competition the markets for the company products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses many of the company competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by imitating the company products and infringing on its intellectual property the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services principal competitive factors important to the company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation strong third party software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation apple inc form the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories and services the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and service offerings with large customer bases in addition some of the company competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at loss the company services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the company product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer supply of components although most components essential to the company business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources the company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased the continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company requirements the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all substantially all of the company hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the and ireland research and development because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure continual and timely flow of competitive products

development licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third party businesses and technology intellectual property the company currently holds broad collection of intellectual property

of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products in addition to company owned intellectual property many of the company products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all apple inc form business seasonality and product introductions the company has historically experienced

disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company financial condition and operating results interest rate risk the company exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the company cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company debt the company investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company liquidity requirements the company uses combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity as of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company debt as of september and september to increase by million and million on an annualized basis respectively foreign currency risk in general the company is net receiver of currencies other than the dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular strengthening of the dollar will negatively affect the company net sales and gross margins as expressed in dollars there is risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures apple inc form to provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company foreign currency derivative positions the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the company foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company actual exposures and
